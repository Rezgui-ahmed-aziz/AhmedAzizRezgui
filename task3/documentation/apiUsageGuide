I implemented the tests using postman.

To test every functionality you can follow this pattern


POST http://localhost:3000/tasks/ 
with the body being a json file similar to this 
{
    "title": "hello",
    "descrip": "hello",
    "priority": "hi",
    "category": "hi",
    "due_date": "hi",
    "completion_status": "hi"
}


Now our data base will have this element added.

Then we can show our elements filtered by category OR due_date like this 

GET http://localhost:3000/tasks/hi/hi

then we can update the values of our element by using this command that takes a title (primary key) as a parameter

PUT http://localhost:3000/tasks/hello
with the body being a json file similar to this 
{
    "title": "hi",
    "descrip": "instadeep test",
    "priority": "low",
    "category": "hi",
    "due_date": "hi",
    "completion_status": "hi"
}

now our element will be updated.

Finaly to delete any element we can use this command, it takes the title of a task to delete it!

DELETE http://localhost:3000/tasks/hi

I also defined a function to retrieve an element by title, you can use it by doing this command

GET http://localhost:3000/tasks/hi 

(make sure to add another element first as following this usage guide will lead to an empty database up to this point)
